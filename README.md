# CS224n - assignment 3
 CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

In this assignment, you will build a neural dependency parser using PyTorch. For a review of the fundamentals of PyTorch, please check out the PyTorch review session on Canvas.  In Part 1, you will learn about two general neural network techniques (Adam Optimization and Dropout). In Part 2, you will implement and train a dependency parser using the techniques from Part 1, before analyzing a few erroneous dependency parses.
